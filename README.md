## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

I decided to use the Grid layout for this project. I want to be more comfortable with Grid as I am with Flexbox. I have learned to utilize @mixins more using SASS. I have also implemented the BEM naming convention for my CSS classes.

### Continued development

I want to improve on using HTML semantic tags for better accessibility of users. I want to have lesser but more clean and efficient code.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/transform-css-generator.html) - This helped me generate the Box Shadow of the Payment Button and the Card. This has made my workflow more efficient since I did not have to guess what values I was going to give the box shadow property.
- [BEM Naming Convention](https://getbem.com/naming/) - This is an amazing guide for the BEM Naming convention. This taught me how to write better and concise class names for my elements.
